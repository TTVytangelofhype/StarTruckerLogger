Welcome to My Fun Little Project for a game I enjoy. Just to let you know, this is not part of the work. I did it, and it was just a small fun project. You will have to manually add the job yourself until I can get it automated. This goes well for a VTC company on StarTrucker. 
Please read the license and do not remove any coding with the dotted lines. 

To compile the logger:
1. Open the provided C# file in Visual Studio
2. Build it as a Console Application (.NET 6 or later)
3. Run to auto-log jobs from a game's status file or post to your API

Note: Replace this README when the real EXE is compiled on your system.
